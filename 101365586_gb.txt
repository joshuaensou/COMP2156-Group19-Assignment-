The George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology, situated in downtown Toronto (Ontario, Canada), is a publicly funded and fully accredited institution of applied arts and technology. It operates from three separate campuses. As with several other educational institutions in Ontario, the government of Ontario granted a charter to George Brown College in 1966, and it commenced operations in the subsequent year.
